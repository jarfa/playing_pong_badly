# Playing Pong Poorly

It's easy to use Reinforcement Learning to win at Pong. But how many ways can your program learn to lose?

This was inspired by Andrej Karpathy's [Pong from Pixels](http://karpathy.github.io/2016/05/31/rl/) blog post. I ported his code to [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), and started playing with other loss functions to incentivize weird and fun behavior.
